## Special Relativity: Week 3 Afternoon
Theorem: (Invariance Principle) All non-accelerating observers agree on the laws of physics. The speed of light is a law of physics. Therefore, all non-accelerating observers see light moving at the same speed. This speed is called $c$, and it's about $3 \cdot 10^8$ meters per second. 

Creation: Light clock, a device with a lighgt bulb, a mirror, and a detector that detects when light reaches it. The distance between the light bulb and the mirror is 3 meters, and the light travels a total distance of 6 meters when it reaches the detector.
