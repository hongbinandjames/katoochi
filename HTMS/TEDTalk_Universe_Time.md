You might be wondering why I have a tiny dot in the middle of the screen to begin the presentation with. Well, this is 
no ordinary dot. This dot contains all matter, space, and time, condensed into an infinitely small point with an 
infinite density. This is the Big Bang Theory, and it states that this dot expanded outward at the speed of light, 
bringing into existence the universe as we know it today. The term we use to describe this expanding force is inflation. 
Our universe is still expanding, to this day, and it's speeding up. Aside from that, out of these three things brought 
into existence, I want to focus on time. Time is a lot more complicated than you think. You can’t directly describe 
time clearly enough so that everyone understands, but we can observe examples on how time is affected in our universe. 
Let’s look at this point right here. This is the arrow of time. Why an arrow? Well, time, to us, only moves in one 
direction, like an arrow. At the beginning of this arrow, we have already talked about the Big Bang, or when time was 
created. However, at the end of the arrow, we have the end of the universe. The end of the universe has three main 
theories, The Big Freeze, The Big Crunch, and The Big Rip. Apparently, scientists really like the word “big”, for some 
reason. Anyway, these three theories all depend on the battle between gravity, the attracting force between objects, 
and inflation, which we already learned about. Whichever force wins will determine the outcome.

In the first theory, 
The Big Freeze, inflation wins. Stars will die out, solar systems will be pulled apart, and galaxies will dissolve into 
lonely objects floating in space. It is worth mentioning that inflation is not accelerating anymore. The universe will 
still expand, but not enough to cause damage to individual objects themselves. And, as mentioned before, time itself 
ends. In the second theory, the Big Crunch, gravity wins this time. Everything will get nearer towards each other, and 
galaxies will overlap. Eventually, the universe will be at a state equal to the Big Bang. This means that if this were 
to happen, then this second Big Bang could kickstart another expansion and another universe. Of course, we will never 
know how many future, or even past universes have already happened. And again, it is the end of time. In the third 
theory, the Big Rip, inflation wins again, but this time, acceleration does not stop. Everything will start to expand, 
and atoms will be ripped apart. You might guess by this point, that again, time ends. 

Next, I want to introduce a 
concept called relativity. If a man is walking 4 mph and a train is going 50 mph in the other direction, then what 
is the speed of the man? At first, this may seem like an obvious question, as you may be tempted to say that he is 
only walking 4 mph. However, it is not that simple. If you were a conductor on the train, then it would seem to you 
that the man is walking towards you at 54 mph. If you were an astronaut in space, even though you may not see the man, 
his speed would be around 68,000 mph from your point of view. As you can see, there are many, we call these, 
“points of reference” that we can use to determine an objects speed. This is why we say that speed is relative. 
At least, for everything except light. Proved by many experiments during the 20th century, the speed of light does not 
change depending on an observer. Just think of light as a really fast train. This is one of the key components 
of Albert Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, and we can use this to show how time varies. This concept is called 
time dilation. Say there is another planet named Planet X. Planet X sends out a beam of light with a speed of 300,000 
k/s towards the earth. The earth then sends a spaceship at 150,000 k/s towards the beam of light. Now, how can the 
speed of light be the same to an observer on the spaceship? The only way this can happen is if time itself slows down. 
Try to picture yourself on the spaceship while time around you slows down. The beam of light will be the same speed to 
you! We have just proved that time is relative. To conclude, The Big Bang was the huge explosion that created all matter
and space while starting time, and the end of the universe has three main theories: The Big Freeze, The Big Crunch, and 
The Big Rip, which in all of these, the end of time occurs. We learned that time is relative; it depends on the speed 
of the observer, and instead of a big, main, arrow of time, each object has their own, depending on their speed. This 
makes way for interesting questions, like “Does a person who walks faster have a longer life, in general?” or “If we 
go fast enough, can we travel back in time?” Think about all the possibilities this opens!
