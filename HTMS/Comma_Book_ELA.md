2. Use a comma after an introductory clause or phrase
3. Use a comma between all items in a series
4. Use commas to set off nonrestrictive clauses
5. Use a comma to set off appositives

### Introduction
There once was a soft and golden piece of paper, so majestic, and so full of glory, that it was at once crowned the king of all papers by the ruler before him. The King lived in Royalville, Origamiland, a place where only the most royal of origami lived. Throughout the entirety of the country, the King was the most beautiful being to exist, and he took the form of a striking origami crane.

One day, the King wanted to take a walk through the streets, as it had been a long time since he smelled the fresh, crisp air.

  “What a beautiful day this is!” the golden bird exclaimed. 
  
Suddenly, a crowd of other origami cranes surrounded him. 

  “All hail the king!” the birds shouted, “All hail the king!”
  
  The King was confused. “Why are you all praising me? What have I done to deserve this?”
  
  “Your glorious presence! Your alluring nature! Your ever-lasting riches!” All the birds expressed their thankfulness to the King. 
  The King frowned. *But those are just things that I was given for my existence,* he thought. I haven’t even done anything yet!
He managed to shrug away the cranes, pat his feathers, and continue his journey.

### Star City
  Soon, the King arrived at Star City, a place where the kingdom’s loyal, military ninja stars lived. The skies were filled with lights that shined brighter than the sun, and the town was decorated with magnificent designs. In tune with Royalville, the residents of Star City huddled around the King and gasped.

“Look! It’s the King!”

The crowd was mixed with shouts of, “Your Highness, Can I get your autograph?” and “I’m your biggest fan!”

Again, the King was dumbfounded, but he realized that he was beginning to like his constant praise. “Thank you, thank you!” he returned. The King stayed in Star City much longer than he did in Royalville.

### Port
  The King, resuming his adventure, came to a town named Port. Port was infamous for being the kingdom’s primary food source, with its civilians, origami boats, fishing up to three tons of fish every day. The salty breeze and the colorful buildings made the King feel like it was something out of a fantasy story. When the King stepped foot into the city, he noticed that his arrival was tamer than Star City and Royalville. His arrival was met with more, “Wow, it’s the king!” instead of the normal swarm that surrounded him. 
  While the King stopped in a local bakery to pick up some food for his trip, he asked the baker, “How come the people don’t recognize me the same way as the other towns do?”
  
The baker, who was afraid of how the King would react, lied, “We appreciate you just as much as the other towns, but all of our fishing has made us too tired to celebrate you appropriately.” 
The King was satisfied with this answer and went on with his journey.

### Monkeyland
After his long and eventful day, the King stopped in Monkeyland to rest. Trees that reached the sun were littered around, and countless bananas were scattered on the ground. The King figured that somebody was willing to let him rest in their home, given his status. He knocked on a door.

“Who there?” a voice called from inside the home.

“It is I, the King, and I am requesting a good night’s rest.”

“Who that?” the voice answered.

The King was speechless. “You must be joking. Give me a good bed at once, or I will make you suffer.”
“Ok.” 

The door creaked open, and the figure that stood at the doorway revealed to be an animal with two, round ears, and a long, skinny tail.

“Thank you,” the King said, relieved. 
	As he slipped into bed, the King noticed that he was still restless. His mind was full of thoughts of resentment directed towards the monkey for not recognizing the wonderful creature that the King was.

### Scrappy
From Monkeyland, the King went to Scrappy, the last town of the kingdom. Scrappy was infamous for being the poorest city, but the King was still hoping to have an amazing end to his trip. Upon his arrival, he immediately noticed the dirty state that Scrappy was in. How will they be able to honor me with such filth? he thought. The King decided to make his presence known.

“People of Scrappy! Kneel before me, for I am the greatest being that has walked this kingdom!”
 
The crumpled-up origami were not impressed.
 
“Who are you? How dare you ask us to worship you?”
 
The King was now faced with a crowd similar to that of Royalville and Star City, except that this one was not as happy.
Someone yelled, “Throw him into the dungeon!” and cries of agreement followed.
 
The King was enraged. He tried to shout, “I will make you all suffer! Your friends and family will perish on my command!” but it was not heard over the bellows of the crowd. 
Thus, the King was to spend the rest of his life rotting in the dungeons of Scrappy, never to be seen again.
