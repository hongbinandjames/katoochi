**When you** hear of car accidents, or fatal deaths from car crashes, what do you think of? Drinking while driving is a 
major one, but, believe it or not, age can also affect the outcome of a driver at an intersection. Are teens actually 
comparable to fully grown adults with completely developed brains, in terms of driving? I think not. Most parents will 
probably agree that they do not want to be relying on a possibly immature and indecisive teenager to drive safely. Even 
the statistics show that teens tend to have more car crashes, and science points to the fact that their brains are also 
vulnerable.

**To begin with**, areas that raised their driving ages saw death rates decrease. The article, "Raise the Driving Age?" 
explains, "Institute researchers have compiled data from New Jersey, the only state that issues licenses at 17. The 
rate of teens killed in crashes in New Jersey has been consistently lower than in nearby states. Crash-related deaths 
among 16- and 17-year-olds were 18 per 100,000 miles in New Jersey. This is compared with 26 per 100,000 miles in 
Connecticut. Those rates have dropped even further since both states started graduated driver's license programs. 
Graduated licensing requires teens to spend more time driving with a responsible adult before they go solo. 
Many states tie these more stringent standards to declining teen crash rates." This demonstrates a situation where 
driving at a later age definitely helps with car crashes, as New Jersey, with their legal driving age at 17, 
experienced less incidents of fatal accidents. Since most of the states issue licenses at 16, New Jersey proved that 
only one year of development can make a big difference. Another statistic further exemplifies this point: "Between 1995 
and 2004, there were 30,917 fatalities in accidents that involved 15-to-17-year-old drivers, according to a study by 
the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. About a third of those deaths were the teen drivers themselves. The rest were 
pedestrians, passengers, and people in cars that teenage drivers struck." This surprising data reveals that not only 
are the teenagers suffering negative effects for driving, but other people are, too. Our worry should extend from only 
teenagers to everyone else on the road, just because these kids did not receive that extra year of development? 
You might be wondering at this point, "What do you really mean by 'development'?" The article gives evidence again: 
"Also, the teen brain is at a particularly vulnerable point in development. 16-year-olds have the logical reasoning 
of an adult, experts say. But their social and emotional development remains relatively immature and seeks novelty 
and risk. The teenage brain also is particularly vulnerable to distraction and peer pressure. The front portion of 
the brain—which includes control of impulses, judgment and decision-making, and the coordination of 
multi-tasking—matures deep into the 20s, research shows." Evidently, teenager's brains do not possess the capability 
of correct judgement or focus that good drivers need.

**Furthermore**, some parents might not be happy with having to drive their kids to school, or anywhere else for that 
matter. However, these parents are not realizing what is at stake. People, not just their own teenagers, are risking 
themselves because of the underdeveloped teen in the driver's seat. Set side by side to these valuable lives, arriving 
at a football game on time is incomparable. Some other critics might argue that age does not define how people drive. 
On the contrary, age plays a major factor in determining these pedestrian's lives. Evidence from the article supports 
this: "A combination of factors contributes to make teenagers poor drivers. Much of it centers on the complexity of 
driving and teens' tendency to speed more and use seat belts less than older drivers." Combined with the evidence 
that teenagers generally have underdeveloped brains, this surely supports the fact that there is a fine line between 
teenagers and adults in driving.

**Overall**, it is clearly seen that teenagers are not fit to be driving. Multiple statistics and datum have shown how 
teenagers have worse driving skills. In addition, even brain study has been confirmed to support the idea that these 
15 and 16 year old teens are not suitable behind the steering wheel. Arguments such as, "Teens learning how to drive 
can save time," or "Their age does not count for anything" can be ruled out. Think about this. Does the idea of a 
teenager with little maturing or development sound appealing to you?
