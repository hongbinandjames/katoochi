# House of the Scorpion
*Science Fiction by Nancy Farmer*


## Reasoning
Tam Lin connects to a flashlight because he can see people’s true nature like
how a flashlight illuminates its surroundings. For example, Tam Lin saw how devious
Tom was and how corrupted El Patron was. Another reason of why a flashlight
symbolizes Tam Lin is because he guided Matt through his life like how a flashlight
guides someone along a path. Matt has gained most of his moral and survival
knowledge through Tam Lin and his wildlife adventures. Lastly, Tam Lin had a dark and
unrecognizable past. This relates to a flashlight because flashlights only brighten the
space in front of them, but darkness resides behind.

## Quotes
The first quote that compares Tam Lin to a flashlight is from when Matt first gets
to know him on page 70, “’I’ll tell you this: El Patron has his good side and his bad side.
Very dark indeed is his majesty when he wants to be. When he was young, he made a
choice, like a tree does when it decides to grow one way or the other. He grew large
and green until he shadowed over the whole forest, but most of his branches are
twisted.” This quote highlights my first reason for my symbolism; that Tam Lin can see
the true nature in people. In the example provided by the text, Tam Lin is giving hints to
Matt about how deceptive El Patron is. Tam Lin saw that El Patron was not actually as
generous and kind as he seemed to Matt, and he was trying to convey this idea, like
how a flashlight lights up places you can’t see.
The second quote that links Tam Lin to a flashlight is from when Matt was framed
for killing furball on page 134, “’I always say the truth is best even when we find it
unpleasant. Any rat in a sewer can lie. It’s how rats are. It’s what makes them rats. But
a human doesn’t run and hide in dark places, because he’s something more. Lying is
the most personal act of cowardice there is.” This quote shows an example of Tam Lin
giving Matt a moral lesson, a fatherly thing to do. Along with other lessons Tam Lin have
taught Matt, Tam Lin has guided Matt through his life, just like how flashlights guide
people in their path.
Lastly, the third quote shows Tam Lin with a dark and terrible past, but he thinks
of himself as a changed man and does not acknowledge his former self. Page 243
explains, “’So you did kill the children,’ Matt said. ‘I could say it was an accident – and it
was – but that doesn’t take away the horror. I was intending to blow up the prime
minister, a fat toad who deserved it. I simply never considered the other people who
might get in the way. Frankly, I was such a self-important ass, I didn’t care.’” This quote
illustrates how Tam Lin thought his background was not like himself. He expresses his
deep regret for the horrible actions he took. A flashlight is representative of this because
it brightens what is in front but leaves everything behind it dark.

## Choice
Tam Lin chose to drink the wine at the wake, even knowing about its toxic and
fatal contents. He wanted to die because of his unforgivable and traumatic past. A quote
from page 377 explains, “‘Tam Lin did what he wanted to do,’ Celia said. ‘He was guilty
of a terrible crime when he was young, and he could never forgive himself for it. He
believed this last act would make up for everything.’” This illustrates the moral reason of
why Tam Lin decided to kill himself, that he could not live with his previous, horrible life.
Tam Lin’s death connects with a flashlight because it was like a light went out in Matt’s
and Celia’s life.

## Consequence

Since Tam Lin was basically the father of Matt, his death left Matt uncoordinated
and unsure of what to do next. Page 378 explains, “Matt felt utterly drained. Somehow,
he’d expected everything to work out. He’d expected himself, Maria, Tam Lin, and Celia
to someday be happy together. Now it was all ruined. ‘You fool!’ he shouted at the
vanished Tam Lin.” Demonstrated by this quote, Matt was clearly focused on having
Tam Lin by his side. Tam Lin’s moral actions have caused an unexpected hole in Matt’s
life; his future as the Lord of Opium became seemingly unclear with Tam Lin’s passing.
