# Introduction to Algebra B 2024 Problems

1. Find the value of $a$ for which there is exactly one real value of $x$ such that $f(x) = a,$ where
$f(x) = x^2 + 4x - 31 + 2x + 18.$

  $a = x^2 + 4x - 31 + 2x + 18$

  $a = x^2 + 6x - 13$

  $x^2 + 6x - 13 - a = 0$

  $(x+3)^2 - 9 - 13 - a = 0$

  $(x+3)^2 - 22 - a = 0$

  $a = -22$, replace a with $-22$ in the above equation.

  $(x+3)^2 = 0$
