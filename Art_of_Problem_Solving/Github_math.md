# Rotations Challenge Problem #

### Problem: ###
A point, (a, b), is chosen on the graph of a plane, xy. The plane of xy is rotated $\theta$ degrees to make the plane of x'y'. (a, b) has not moved but is instead given a new value (a', b') on the plane of x'y'. What is (a', b') in terms of a, b, and angle $\theta$?

### Things I took away from this problem: ###
1. I know everything about a right triangle if I only have one other angle and one side length.
2. I shouldn't rely too much on the pythagorean theorem, especially when dealing with higher-level problems that involve trigonometry.
3. Divide and conquer: Split the problem up into sections that I can work out.
4. A good way to improve my math skills is to think about the answer of a problem. I should try to come up with easier and simpler solutions when encountering an easy and simple answer.
